This is the code I helped to write for my team [1104A](https://www.robotevents.com/teams/VRC/1104A) for the 2021-2022 VEX Robotics Competition, Tipping Point. Similarly to last year, the code is written in C++ and uses the [PROS](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/) library. Unlike last year, control code was a lot more sophisticated with more options for advanced PID control, a GUI selector for autonomous programs, and experiments with feed-forward control.

Due to extenuating circumstances, my team was not able to compete at worlds despite qualifying. The robot was instead donated to team [1104Z](https://www.robotevents.com/teams/VRC/1104Z) where they placed 11th in the Opportunity Division.
