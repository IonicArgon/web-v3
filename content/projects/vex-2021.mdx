This is the code I helped write for my team [1104A](https://www.robotevents.com/teams/VRC/1104A) for the 2020-2021 VEX Robotics Competition, Change Up. The code is written in C++ and uses the [PROS](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/) library. It makes use of basic tracking sensors, colour sensors, and PID loops to automate robot movements and ball indexing. We submitted this code to the Annotated Programming Skills Challenge.
