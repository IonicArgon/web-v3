Hi, I want to figure out some custom formatting for my own tags inside these project files.

## I'll figure out why the headings don't render later

blah blah blah **this is a bold thing**

this is _italicized_

1. here is a numbered list
2. here is another item
3. here is a third item

- here is a bullet list
- here is another item
- here is a third item

> BLAH BLAH BLAH
