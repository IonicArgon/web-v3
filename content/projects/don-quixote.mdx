I found myself playing a lot of Limbus Company and I fell in love with this silly little creature depicted below:

I decided I would write a little Python bot based on her character. All it would have was a few annoucement routines for both text channels and voice channels alike.

## Version 1

The first version used [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for everything bot-related. Halfway through the development of this version, I found out that Discord.py was no longer being maintained and a fork of it ([Pycord](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/stable/)) should've been the one I was using, but I wanted to finish this one anyway. The most complex thing about the bot was storing settings in a TOML file, but that's about it.

Morning messages looked something like this:

Pings for when you started Limbus Company looked like this:

And if you were in a voice channel, it would do this:

## Version 2

Version 2 was created because Discord.py was depricated, a few features were requested from the people the bot interacted with, and I wanted to add a few features of my own. The framework was moved over to Pycord and settings continued to be saved in a TOML file. However, settings were now saved on a per-server basis, meaning this bot was now multi-server capable (even though I never deployed it to other servers). There were also a few new features:

- Sending the embeds used a webhook so that the bot's name and avatar could be changed. This allowed me to add the other identities like so:

- The bot stopped mentioning people when sending the embed because a lot of people thought it was kinda annoying (myself included):

There were some experiments with using Docker to deploy the bot, but I never quite got it to work on my Raspberry Pi, so I just ended up sending the files over through VNC and running it manually. I also wanted to fool around with using CharacterAI to make the bot say silly things, but the trained model on the website was not to my liking, so I never got around to it.
