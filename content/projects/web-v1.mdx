This is my first version of this portfolio website. I used Next.js for the main framework and Chakra UI for the styling. I also used Framer Motion for the animations. I used Vercel to deploy the website. The biggest problem with this website is that the project and blog pages are static and have to be manually updated; I am creating a new website that will not have this problem.
